# Introduction

This folder contains example code for the project.

# Loading data

Since the data is stored in Parquet format, we can use the `pandas` library to load the data.
Note that the data is stored using the pyarrow engine, so please make sure to install the `pyarrow` library.

Please refer to the `load_data.py` script for an example.
